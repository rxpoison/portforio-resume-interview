            I'm usually a Full stack developer, but my favorite subject is Front-end developer.
            I like to work as a team and likes to plan before work.
            From that past experience Sometimes the company is assigned work with me to manage a small team until the process of deploying work into the cloud system.
            
            <br />
            I'm mostly a quiet person. but more serious about work can adapt easily I always like to learn something new. I can endure hard work. I am always open to all opinions.
